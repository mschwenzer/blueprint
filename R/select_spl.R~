##' Help function to split a df into two disjunct dfs
##'
##' select_spl splits a data.frame into two, one containing some specified variables and one not containing some variables. Like dplyr::select it returns the df with matching columns but additionally writes the other non-matching columns to a object in the calling environment. This is a potentially destructive function for its sideeffect of creating other.df.
##' @title select_spl
##' @param df A data.frame to split
##' @param vars a string of variables conform with select_.
##' @param other.df Name of a newly created df with the variables not matching.
##' @return df

    df %>% select_(.dots=vars) %>% assign(df1,.,envir=e)
    df %>% select_(.dots=vars %>% stringr::str_replace('^','-')) %>% assign(df2,.,envir=e)
